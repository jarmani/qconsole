qconsole is a simple application that makes an xterm window behave like the
drop-down console on the game "Quake" (and probably many others).

When qconsole is started, it spawns an xterm with the "`-into`" option to
reparent it under qconsole, and then hides it offscreen.

To show the terminal, press `Control+O` and it will scroll onto the screen.
press it again and it will scroll back off the screen.  If the xterm is killed,
a new one will be spawned.

The xterm is launched with a name of `qconsole`.  To adjust its colors and
font, add xterm X resources to your X resources file (and maybe run xrdb) such
as:


		.qconsole*background:           white
		.qconsole*foreground:           black
		.qconsole*internalBorder:       5
		.qconsole*utmpInhibit:          true
		.qconsole*rightScrollBar:       true

To adjust the window height, use the `-h` option.  To adjust the speed that the
console scrolls, use the `-s` option (1 to 10, default of 9).
To change the key binding use -k <modifier>+<key> or -k <key>. Only one modifier
is supported and value can be alt, ctrl, shift or super.
